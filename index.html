            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>
                Wardell Stephen "Steph" Curry II (/ˈstɛfən/ STEF-ən; born March 14, 1988[1]) is an American professional
                basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He plays
                the point guard position. Many analysts and players have called him the greatest shooter in NBA
                history.[2] He is credited with revolutionizing the game of basketball by inspiring teams to regularly
                utilize the three-point shot.[3][4][5] A seven-time NBA All-Star, Curry has been named the NBA Most
                Valuable Player (MVP) twice and has won three NBA championships with the Warriors.<br><br>

                The son of former NBA player Dell and older brother of current NBA player Seth, Curry played college
                basketball for the Davidson Wildcats. He set the all-time scoring record for both Davidson and the
                Southern Conference and was twice named the conference's player of the year. During his sophomore year,
                Curry also set the single-season NCAA record for three-pointers made, and was then selected by the
                Warriors with the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft.<br><br>

                In 2014–15, Curry won his first MVP award and led the Warriors to their first championship since 1975.
                The following season, he became the first player in NBA history to be elected MVP by a unanimous vote
                and to lead the league in scoring while shooting above 50–40–90. That same year, the Warriors broke the
                record for the most wins in an NBA season en route to reaching the 2016 NBA Finals, which they lost to
                the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games. Curry helped the Warriors return to the NBA Finals in 2017, 2018
                and 2019, winning back-to-back titles in 2017 and 2018, before being defeated by the Toronto Raptors in
                2019.<br><br>

                During the 2012–13 season, Curry set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a regular season, with
                272. He surpassed that record in 2015 with 286, and again in 2016 with 402. He is currently second in
                all-time made three-pointers in NBA history. Curry and teammate Klay Thompson have earned the nickname
                of the Splash Brothers; in 2013–14, they set the record for combined three-pointers in an NBA season
                with 484, a record they broke the following season (525), and again in the 2015–16 season (678)<br><br>
